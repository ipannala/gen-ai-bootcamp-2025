#Business Requirements
The objective of this application is to help English-speaking users learn Spanish. The user will learn Spanish by providing English phrases to a chatbot. The chatbot will then guide the user to translate the English phrase into Spanish by providing translations, parts of speech tagging, and sentence construction.

#Functional Requirements
Create an interactive chatbot that the user can use as a teacher to learn Spanish. It is important that the chatbot tutors the user and not just provide direct translations of phrases. The chatbot must walkthrough phrases so that the user can understand and apply concepts in the future.

#Risks
The risks of the application are errors. Because LLMs are relatively new these models can generate inaccurate information. As the developer of the application, we must conduct intensive testing to ensure the application is accurate.

#Assumptions
The user will have the computing power required to run the application. The application as of now will not be developed in the cloud. The user must have the appropriate hardware requirements to run the application.

#Data Strategy
The user will not have to worry about privacy because the application will run locally. The user's data will be stored locally. While we cannot guarantee that the LLM developer companies will not have access to the user's queries, this is a risk the user must accept.
